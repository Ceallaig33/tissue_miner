# First Use of TissueMiner with example data

### 1. Open a terminal

* If you don't know how to open a terminal, click [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)

### 2. Download the example data set (~100 Mb)

Just copy and paste the lines below **into your terminal** and press Enter:

     ## Go to the movie directory
     cd example_movie/demo_ForTissueMiner
```

### 3. Select the analysis you are interested in

Here, we propose some streamlined quickstart tutorials.

* [Cell area](cell_area.md)
* [Cell elongation](cell_elongation.md)
* [Cell packing](cell_packing.md)
* [Cell lineage and divisions](cell_lineage_and_divisions.md)
* [Cell rearrangements](cell_rearrangements.md)
* [Cell contributions to tissue shear](cell_contributions_to_tissue_shear.md)
* [Cell contributions to tissue area changes](cell_contributions_to_tissue_area_changes.md)

### 4. Look at the results 
In your current movie folder, a **new output_analysis folder** has been created, where you'll find plots and videos created by running the tutorials.
