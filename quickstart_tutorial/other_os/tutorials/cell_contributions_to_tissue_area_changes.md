# Cell contributions to tissue area change analysis

Cell contributions to tissue area changes are easily calculated from the database. It is therefore sufficient to build the database only.


### 1. Plot the rate of tissue area changes and its cellular contributions

* Copy-paste the following commands in the terminal:

```
tm sm make_db
tm cell_contributions_to_tissue_area_change_rate.R . output_analysis
```
